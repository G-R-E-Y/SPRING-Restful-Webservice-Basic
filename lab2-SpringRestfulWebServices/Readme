To get start page:
==================

http://localhost:8080/lab2-SpringRestfulWebServices/

Test your REST service under:
=============================

URL :  http://localhost:8080/lab2-SpringRestfulWebServices/countries

Accept: application/xml
Content-Type: application/xml

Note : Also, try with json
